# 🔧 Compiler Design Toolkit Web App

This project is a **web-based compiler toolkit** that provides essential modules for **Lexical Analysis** and **Intermediate Code Generation**. It is designed to help students and enthusiasts understand key concepts of compiler design through interactive features.

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 **Lexical Analyzer**: Users can input source code and tokenize it using a custom lexer built in JavaScript.
- 📊 **Token Display**: Tokens are displayed in a clean and structured table format.
- ⚙️ **Intermediate Code Generator**: Automatically generates intermediate representations such as **Three-Address Code (TAC)** or **Quadruples**.
- 💾 **Session History (optional)**: You may implement local storage or a backend of your choice to store user inputs and results.
